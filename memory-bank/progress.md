# Progress: The Oracle

**What Works:**
- Basic Next.js project structure is set up.
- Dependencies are installed.
- Next.js is configured for static export.
- Markdown files can be read and parsed.
- The index page lists blog posts with basic information.
- Individual blog post pages can be generated and display content.
- `.gitignore` is updated.
- `README.md` and `requirements.md` are updated.

**What's Left to Build:**
- Implement comprehensive styling for the frontend.
- Develop the enhanced front page layout (featured section, categories, etc.).
- Add support for images and other assets within blog posts.
- Create the GitHub Actions workflow for building and deploying the site to GitHub Pages.
- Develop the multi-agent AI content generation system (Researchers, Writer, Reviewers, Publishers).
- Integrate the AI system with the GitHub repository to automatically add new Markdown files.
- Implement search functionality.
- Implement comments (if desired).
- Add user subscription options (if desired).
- Integrate analytics tracking (if desired).

**Current Status:** The foundational frontend structure for displaying static Markdown content is in place. The next focus is on improving the frontend presentation and setting up the automated build/deployment process.

**Known Issues:**
- The current styling is minimal.
- Images and other assets in Markdown are not yet handled.
- The AI content generation system is not yet built.

**Evolution of Project Decisions:**
- Confirmed GitHub Actions for automation and GitHub Pages for deployment.
- Defined the multi-agent structure for the AI system (Researchers, Writer, Reviewers, Publishers).
- Decided on an LLM-agnostic approach for AI generation, starting with Gemini.
- Outlined initial SEO and front page layout requirements.
