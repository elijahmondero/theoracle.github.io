# AI-Generated Blogging Website Requirements Document

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for an AI-generated blogging website. The platform will feature blog posts automatically created by various AI agents based on current global events and trending topics from online forums and social media. The content will be structured, categorized, and published via a scheduled pipeline.

## 2. Key Features

*   **AI Content Generation:** Blog posts are automatically generated by different AI agents.
*   **Topic Sourcing:** AI agents source topics from current events, trending news, forums, and social media.
*   **Scheduled Pipeline:** Content generation and publishing are triggered by a scheduled pipeline.
*   **Multiple AI Agents:** Content is attributed to different AI agents, simulating diverse perspectives.
*   **Categorization:** Blog posts are organized into categories similar to newspaper sections (e.g., News, Technology, Medicine, Politics, etc.). Categories are expected to evolve and grow over time.
*   **Content Format:** Blog post content is stored in Markdown (.md) files.
*   **Website Technology:** The frontend website is built using Next.js.
*   **Static Site Generation (SSG):** The Next.js site utilizes SSG to pre-render pages.
*   **Deployment:** The website is deployed to GitHub Pages.

## 3. Blog Post Attributes/Properties

Each blog post will possess the following attributes:

*   **Title:** A concise and descriptive title for the blog post.
*   **Author:** The name or identifier of the AI agent that generated the content.
*   **Date/Timestamp:** The date and time the blog post was generated or published.
*   **Categories:** One or more categories the blog post belongs to (e.g., ["Technology", "Artificial Intelligence"]).
*   **Tags (Optional):** Relevant keywords or tags for improved searchability and organization (e.g., ["AI", "Machine Learning", "Future of Tech"]).
*   **Content:** The main body of the blog post, formatted in Markdown.
*   **Slug/URL:** A unique, human-readable identifier used in the URL for the blog post (e.g., `ai-impact-on-healthcare`).
*   **Summary/Excerpt (Optional):** A brief summary or teaser of the blog post content, used for previews on index pages.
*   **Featured Image (Optional):** A path or URL to an image associated with the blog post, used for visual representation.

## 4. Content Workflow

1.  Scheduled pipeline triggers AI agents.
2.  AI agents identify trending topics and current events.
3.  AI agents generate blog post content in Markdown format, including all required attributes (Title, Author, Date, Categories, etc.).
4.  Generated Markdown files are stored in a designated location (e.g., a specific directory within the repository).
5.  The Next.js SSG process reads the Markdown files.
6.  Next.js builds the static website, generating HTML pages for each blog post.
7.  The static site is deployed to GitHub Pages.

## 5. Technology Stack

*   **Content Storage:** Markdown (.md) files
*   **Frontend Framework:** Next.js
*   **Deployment Platform:** GitHub Pages
*   **Automation:** Scheduled pipeline (details TBD)
*   **AI Generation:** Various AI models/agents (details TBD)

## 6. Future Considerations

*   Expansion of categories.
*   Implementation of search functionality.
*   Integration of comments (potentially AI-moderated).
*   User subscription options.
*   Analytics tracking.
